# Clicky-Game

# Overview
The Kimoji Game is a web game application where users click the kimoji icon images in order to earn points. You win the game whenever you have clicked all 12 of the icons only once. The only catch is that the kimojis reshuffle in their location with every click. If the same image is clicked twice the game will be reset. Each correct click increments the users score by 1. The highest score for the session is saved and displayed to the user.
